# Fifa-World-Cup-Analysis
here's how I  approached ETL and EDA for FIFA World Cup data:

Extract: Obtain FIFA World Cup data from reliable sources such as official FIFA websites, datasets available on platforms like Kaggle, or through APIs if available.

Transform:

Clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Extract relevant features such as match outcomes, teams, players, goals scored, etc.
Calculate statistics like total goals scored, average goals per match, win/loss ratios for teams, etc.
Analyze trends over time, such as the frequency of tournaments, host countries, and changes in tournament format.
Explore relationships between variables, such as the performance of teams from different continents, home advantage, etc.
Load: Store the transformed data in a suitable format for further analysis and visualization, such as a CSV file, a relational database
